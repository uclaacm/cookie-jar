# Cookie Jar
üç™üçûüé∂
## Overview
A lesson to teach kids about web cookies! We're cooking up some \~recipes\~ everything from sweet session cookies to zesty third party persistent cookies :0

## Development Setup

Lured by the smell? We're hiring bakers. Here's how to get started:

First, let's clone our repository, and install all of our node dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/uclaacm/cookie-jar.git
cd cookie-jar
npm install
```

To start our app for development, you just need to run `npm run dev`!

```
npm run dev
```

And to build our project for production (with CRA's webpack bundling and all that goodness),

```
npm run build
```

## Contribution Workflow

Ready to bake some goodness? Here are the steps:

1. Make sure your main branch is updated with other peoples' changes.
   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

2. Make a new branch of this repository. `main` is a protected branch, **so you cannot push to it**.
   a. For branch naming, follow this convention: `<issue-number>_<change-you-made>` (e.g. `88_animate_cookies`).
   ```
   git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
   ```
3. Implement your code changes for your feature: Mix and knead away! 
   - Before committing, run `npm lint`.
4. Once you're ready, stage and commit your changes.
   - Please include the # followed by the issue number in your commit message to create a reference.
   ```
   git commit -m <your-message>
   ```
5. Move your local branch changes to remote repository.
   **Before pushing**, make sure that your app builds with `npm run build`, without any errors.
   ```
   git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name>
   ```
6. Make a pull request with your changes, and let someone on your project team know. Assign a reviewer.
7. If your code passes code review, then we can **squash and merge** it into `main`. Congratulations! If you'd like, it's now safe to delete your branch locally.
